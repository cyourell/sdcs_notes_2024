====== Hybrid tables talk ======
Created Tuesday 04 June 2024

* Just caught the end of this talk while waiting for [[What's New:Python Data Pipelines]]
* This is currently a preview feature.
* CREATE HYBRID TABLE ()INDEX() INCLUDE())
* A hybrid table is a Snowflake table type that is optimized for hybrid transactional and operational workloads that require low latency and high throughput on small random point reads and writes. A hybrid table supports unique and referential integrity constraint enforcement that is critical for transactional workloads. 
	* SHOW LOCKS, SHOW TRANSACTIONS, to identify blocking.
* Optimizing hybrid tables
	* Use X-SMALL warehouses for low-latency point operations
	* Use multi-cluster warehouses for high concurrency
	* Isolate hybrid workloads as much as possible
	* Index Tuning
		* Indexes are automatically created to support efficient constraint enforcement
		* Hybrid tables support online index creation - no blocking
		* Indexes improve performance but incud I/O and storage cost 
		* Use indexes on columns with selective predicates
	* Do not use complicated predicates (ilike '%' or substr () = '')
*
