==== Collaboration: A Business Necessity to Accelerate Digital Transformation ====
=== Speakers: ===
* Colm Moynihan - Senior Solution Architect @ Snowflake
=== Notes: ===
* Background
	* Talk was inspired by Gartner: Data Sharing is a Business Necessity to Accelerate Digital Business
	* Timeline:
		* 1st gen - FTP/File-based
			* ETL required both ways.
			* Proprietary APIs.
			* Never in real time.
			* Multiple copies of data
		* 2nd gen - Cloud IaaS 
			* Cloud Object Store
			* File based
			* ETL required
			* J2EE Apps
			* Java APIs
		* 3rd gen - Snowflake Data Cloud
			* Marketplace
			* Multi-cloud
			* Database/table/view
			* No ETL
			* Native Apps
			* Real-Time
			* Security 6 Governance
			* Container Services
* Consuming Data
	* Snowflake Marketplace 
		* Currently 2500 datasets/services/apps & growing 104% year over year adoption
		* This can be done privately as well
* Providing Data
	* This can be used to monetize data - it can be published on the marketplace publically.
		* There are a lot of options for paid providers, including customizing the pricing (month, per query, etc), and providing multiple "grades" of the data.
	* This can be used cross-platform as long as regions match.
	* There is a "Provider Studio" for these functions.
* Collaborative Apps
	* Very few people have built these
	* Dockerized can be pushed to Snowflake using Snowpark.
	* Snowflake Data Clean App is a native app in Snowflake, installed to our instance from marketplace. Built-in privacy and governance.
	* Experian has an app for consumer credit
* Summary
	* Benefits of Collaboration
		* Break down data silos and reduce costs
		* Build collaborative culture
		* Enhance customer/partner experience - single view of data
* Quesitons
	* Is it possible to publish private datasets/apps only shared to specific users?
		* Yes. You would need a "locator" for this, for the user.
	* What do most providers charge?
		* Monthly/Annually is the norm, not per query or per M records.
=== End Notes: ===
* We should evaluate the Snowflake Marketplace for valuable free datasets.
* We should check out apps as well.
* Chcek out Experian credit score datasets on mraketplace (or do they use an app?)
* We can also use up to 10% unused credits on our plan for buying data, so when those credits expire we can shop around.
