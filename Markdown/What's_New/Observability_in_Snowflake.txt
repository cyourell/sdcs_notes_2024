==== What's New: Observability in Snowflake, WN209 ====
=== Speakers: ===
* Ashwin Kamath, Bogdan Drutu (Snowflake)
=== Notes: ===
* This talk started by addressing issues building apps and data pipelines, not just default observability needs.
	* Complex to start
	* Troubleshoot & Correlate
	* Slow to take action
* Snowflake Trail is the tool covered in this event.
* Query telemetry is now available next to query profile for better troubleshooting. You can add tracers to this for more detail.
	* Notebooks are automatically traced as well.
* They have a line profiler too, so you can check individual line compute cost.
