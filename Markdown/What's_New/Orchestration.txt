==== What's New with Orchestration in Snowflake ====
=== Speakers: ===
* Manuela Wei
* Joe Tobey
=== Notes: ===
* Tasks are considered the native orchestration/scheduling tool in Snowflake. **Serverless tasks** are an alternative
	* Why use them?
		* No burden for managing on-prem/cloud orchestration products
		* Don't have to manage compute
		* Optimized for price performance
		* Dynamically right-sizes compute based on job profle
* What's New: Orchestration
* Task Graph Enhancements
	* Observability - this seems really useful for troubleshooting
		* **We can suspend/resume in UI now!**
* Trigger Tasks
	* This would be very useful to run tasks triggered by data change events
	* Does this only work on streams?
* Serverless tasks are also plugged into Snowflake budget functionality
* Tasks backfill is available as well.
* Merkle's Success Story (Mekury?)
	* Moved from disparate tools/solutions, that were less secure, into Snowflake tasks
	* How the migration was done 
		* Explore options
		* Work with Snowflake for improvements
		* Testing
		* Improve Process
	* Multiple location managing processes and logging -> all processing/logging moved to Snowflake
	* Outcomes
		* 10-20% cost savings
		* 15-23% processing time improvements
		* 1 location for processing and troubleshooting
			* More efficient troubleshooting, less stressful. 
		* Much easier learning curve. Devs get up to speed faster if it is all in one place.
			* (we could learn from this)

=== End Notes: ===
* Task Graphs seem very useful, review this.
	* Task graphs have success triggers	
	* Task (graphs?) have failure notifications as a feature.
* Use trigger tasks in order to use prod-sourced table updates, based on data changes.
