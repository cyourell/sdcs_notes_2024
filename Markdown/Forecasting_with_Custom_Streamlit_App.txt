=== Notes: ===
* Replacing an excel process for individual warehouse/demand-planning forecasts with a streamlit app and accomodating systems.
* Migrated to:
	* Used Streamlit in Snowflake to take advnatage of fast read/write
	* Built in editing rules to the user interface
	* Maintain record of all forecasts
* Streamlit app was created to monitor warehouse data, then edit forecast based on specific variables.
	* Edits show which accounts make an edit
	* Required to give reason for change made.
* Method:
	* They set up 3 tables
		* Staging
			* Where forecasts are placed (using dataiku?) by default
		* System Facts
			* Forecasts produced with no changes made
		* Edited Facts
			* Forecasts post-edit from users using the streamlit app
	* Records from system/edits are appended into staging, to create a kind of log.
