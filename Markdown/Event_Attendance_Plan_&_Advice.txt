====== Event Attendance Plan & Advice ======
Created Tuesday 04 June 2024

* Sign up for sessions on your agenda ASAP. The events people are most interested in will get filled up quickly.
	* You can go to sessions on a standby line if you are not signed up for them, but you might not be able to get in if it's full.
	* Once you have your agenda, you can export it to an .ical or .vcal and import it to your outlook calendar. These calendar items should include details like room number or theatre name.
		* **Rooms listed on calendar import may change in the future.** Check the live agenda every morning.
* Avoid sessions that are on the partner/demo floor unless it is in one of the larger theatre seating areas. The events outside of the "hub" theaters were too busy to hear/see - watch these later if interested instead. 
* Keynotes are streamed, so you can watch them remote. Sessions are recorded and published after.
* Company/partner-lead breakout sessions are surprisingly good, if you are interested in their topic.
* Lots of partner companies host their own unofficial afterparties, which are usually compiled in a list somewhere. Kevin Hu @ metaplane created a list for 2023 and 2024.
