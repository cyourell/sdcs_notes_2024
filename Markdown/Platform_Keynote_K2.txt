==== Platform Keynote K2 ====
=== Notes: ===
* From President of Product/Benoit Dageville
	* Snowpark to use the same Snowflake engine, but for Python, Java, Scala dataframes
	* Snowpark container services allows you to deploy containerized services w/in Snowflake
		* You can also access GPUs on-demand
	* Snowflake Arctic - family of enterprise-grade models for LLM
		* Private clusters are spun up for every customer account
* From EVP Product Christian Kleinerman
	* Emphasis on getting value out of unstructured data
		* Announcing: Document AI
			* **Generally available "soon"**
			* Ask questions in a natural language, then validate answers.
			* Early example: Northern Trust processing data from financial documents to automate futures reconciliation
			* Ingestion for document AI:
				* File processors are set up for this - you can set up documents to be ingested then pushed to document AI
		* Announcing: **Serverless tasks flex**
			* Allows you to specify a window for task runs, then it will cost-optimize for running - not a specific hhmm time.
		* Iceberg tables **now available**
			* An Iceberg table uses the Apache Iceberg open table format specification, which provides an abstraction layer on data files stored in open formats and supports features such as:
				* ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions
				* Schema evolution
				* Hidden partitioning
				* Table snapshots
		* More Polaris Catalog announcements - also from K1
			* https://www.snowflake.com/blog/introducing-polaris-catalog/
		* Microsoft + Snowflake partnership info:
			* Major expansion in MS+Snowflake partnership.
			* MS Announced "fabric" to merge use of powerBI/AI/Azure
			* Snowflake announced Onelake support in conjunction with MS announcing Iceberg support
		* Snowflake Horizon updates
			* **Data Classification Interface**
				* Automatic tag propogation downstream. See [[Holistic Data Governance]]
			* **Data Lineage - public preview**. Where data comes from/where it goes.
				* ML Lineage
		* Trust Center - seems very useful for security. Can find users without MFA and etc. Generally available soon.
* From Lead Dev advocate / Dash Desai
	* Showing off Internal Marketplace for datasets, apps, AI models, docs.
		* Demo pulling an unknown dataset from marketplace then using AI to generate a query.
* Siemens VP of Data - Dietmar Mauersberger
	* Success story migrating to Snowflake and it's support for their uses.
* From EVP Product Christian Kleinerman
	* Streamlit in Snowflake - already being used heavily by customers
	* Announcing: **Snowpark Container Services now available**
	* Native Apps can now be used with container services
		* Rapid fire to speakers in the audience that were using native apps for specific uses.
* **Demo for native app**
	* Hooking a containerized app to GPU for image generation
	* Hybrid tables
* **Now in public preview:**
	* **Git integration**
	* **Database change management**
	* **Snowflake CLI**
	* **Snowflake notebooks**
	* **Snowpark Pandas API**
* **Snowflake Copilot now generally available**
* **Snowflake trail announcement** 
	* Also see [[What's New:Orchestration]]
* Lots of Cortex announcements after this, Cortex Analyst, Cortex Search 

=== End Notes: ===
* We should be using serverless task flex/cost-optimize task windows immediately. 
* Find cases where we would want to use Internal Marketplace
* Look into Lineage, we should be utilizing this.
* Snowflake notebooks, Pandas API and Git will all be very useful
