==== Using Snowflake Notebooks to Accelerate Your Data Work, AI237 ====
=== Speakers: ===
* Aileen Lu
* Tylor Simons
=== Notes: ===
* Snowflake notebooks addressed a few different issues:
	* Different versioning
	* Local store/cloud store
	* Compute resources
* What Snowflake wanted right in notebooks:
	* Connect to data instantly - no auth issues
	* Interleave python + SQL
	* Interactivity with streamlit
	* Storytelling with Makrdown
* Demo
	* A lot of this we already know. Demoed through SQL/Python cells.
		* Converted cell to pandas w/ cell1.to_pandas()
	* Can look at single CTEs by using cells, if you're writing queries with a lot of CTEs. Our IDE already allows this, but it is a bit cleaner in notebooks for troubleshooting.
* snowflake-ml-python is also integrated
* New features to notebooks
	* Version control with Git
		* **They support bitbucket**, gitlab, etc. as well, not just github.
	* Scheduled runs
	* Access external endpoints (kaggle, data.world? etc.)
	* Cortex & ML Functions
* More demo w/ new features 
	* Demoed cortex sentiment analysis on a field
	* Demoed copilot to write a query to a new cell
	* Can send slack messages from notebook, using an integration
	* Can run a notebook from another notebook
		* CALL EXECUTE NOTEBOOK
	* Scheduling is done in the notebook itself. It has pretty standard options for scheduling.

=== End Notes: ===
* Notebook scheduling seems pretty useful for sending summaries, or standing up would-be tasks faster.
	* Since notebooks have git (does this require integration?) it may also be better for drafting tasks over time.
* Check out snowflake-ml-python
* All of these new feature are in public preview
* Snowflake-managed containers can run notebooks too, so if we want packages that aren't on snowflake anaconda, then you can use that for anything else you would want to pip install OR use GPUs.
